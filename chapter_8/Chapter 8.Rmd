## Q1

_Draw an example (of your own invention) of a partition of two- dimensional feature space that could result from recursive binary splitting. Your example should contain at least six regions. Draw a decision tree corresponding to this partition. Be sure to label all as- pects of your figures, including the regions R1, R2, . . ., the cutpoints t1,t2,..., and so forth.
Hint: Your result should look something like Figures 8.1 and 8.2._

## Q3

_3. Consider the Gini index, classification error, and entropy in a simple classification setting with two classes. Create a single plot that displays each of these quantities as a function of pˆm1. The x- axis should display pˆm1, ranging from 0 to 1, and the y-axis should display the value of the Gini index, classification error, and entropy._

_Hint: In a setting with two classes, pˆm1 = 1 − pˆm2. You could make this plot by hand, but it will be much easier to make in R._

```{r}
data3 <- tibble(
  pm1 = seq(0,1,by=.01), #proportion in region m that is class 1
  pm2 = 1-pm1            #proportion in region m that is class 2
)
```

```{r}
data3 <- data3 %>% 
  mutate(
    E=map2_dbl(pm1,pm2,max),
    G=2*pm1*pm2,
    Ent=map2_dbl(pm1,pm2, function(pm1,pm2) {
      -sum(pm1*log(pm2) , pm2*log(pm1))
    })
  )
```

```{r}
data3 %>% 
  gather(key="criteria",value="value",-pm1,-pm2) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=pm1,y=value,color=criteria)) +
  geom_line(size=2)
```

## Q8 (a,b,c)

_8. In the lab, a classification tree was applied to the Carseats data set af- ter converting Sales into a qualitative response variable. Now we will seek to predict Sales using regression trees and related approaches, treating the response as a quantitative variable._

_(a) Split the data set into a training set and a test set._

```{r}
data("Carseats")
head(Carseats)
dim(Carseats)
set.seed(040518)
train <- sample(1:nrow(Carseats),size=250)
carseats.train <- Carseats[train,]
carseats.test <- Carseats[-train,]
```

_(b) Fit a regression tree to the training set. Plot the tree, and inter- pret the results. What test MSE do you obtain?_

```{r}
tree1 <- tree(Sales ~ . , data= carseats.train)
summary(tree1)
plot(tree1)
text(tree1, pretty = 0)
tree1.predict <- predict(tree1,newdata = carseats.test)
(MSE <- mean((tree1.predict-carseats.test$Sales)^2))
```

_(c) Use cross-validation in order to determine the optimal level of tree complexity. Does pruning the tree improve the test MSE?_

```{r}
tree1.cv <- cv.tree(tree1)
plot(tree1.cv)
tree1.cv
```

CV would suggest not pruning.  I guess we could prune to 16...

```{r}
tree1.prune <- prune.tree(tree1,best=16)
tree1.prune.predict <- predict(tree1.prune, newdata = carseats.test)
(MSE <- mean((tree1.prune.predict-carseats.test$Sales)^2))
```

slight reduction in MSE

## Q9

_9. This problem involves the OJ data set which is part of the ISLR package._

```{r}
data(OJ)
dim(OJ)
?OJ
head(OJ) 
```


_(a) Create a training set containing a random sample of 800 observations, and a test set containing the remaining observations._

```{r}
train <- sample(1:nrow(OJ), size = 800)
oj.train <- OJ[train,]
oj.test <- OJ[-train,]
```

_(b) Fit a tree to the training data, with Purchase as the response and the other variables as predictors. Use the summary() function to produce summary statistics about the tree, and describe the results obtained. What is the training error rate? How many terminal nodes does the tree have?_

```{r}
tree1 <- tree(Purchase ~ . , data=oj.train)
summary(tree1)
```

9 nodes with three predictors, good training prediction (0.1575)

_(c) Type in the name of the tree object in order to get a detailed text output. Pick one of the terminal nodes, and interpret the information displayed._

```{r}
tree1
```

For node 7, these are customers whose CH brand loyalty is > 0.76.  There are 265 such customers.  The deviance at this node is 97.72 (what does this mean) and 95% of the customers at this node bought CH.

_(d) Create a plot of the tree, and interpret the results._

```{r}
plot(tree1)
text(tree1,pretty=0)
```

Loyalty to CH brand is the biggest predictor.  

_(e) Predict the response on the test data, and produce a confusion matrix comparing the test labels to the predicted test labels. What is the test error rate?_

```{r}
oj.prediction <- predict(tree1,newdata = oj.test,type="class")
table(prediction=oj.prediction,observed=oj.test$Purchase)
```

```{r}
(tree1.accuracy <- mean(oj.prediction==oj.test$Purchase))
```

82% prediction accuracy

_(f) Apply the cv.tree() function to the training set in order to determine the optimal tree size._

```{r}
set.seed(1354)
tree1.cv <- cv.tree(tree1,FUN=prune.misclass)
tree1.cv
```

best size appears to be 7

_(g) Produce a plot with tree size on the x-axis and cross-validated classification error rate on the y-axis._

```{r}
plot(tree1.cv$size, tree1.cv$dev / nrow(oj.test),type="l")
```

_(h) Which tree size corresponds to the lowest cross-validated classi- fication error rate?_

7

_(i) Produce a pruned tree corresponding to the optimal tree size obtained using cross-validation. If cross-validation does not lead to selection of a pruned tree, then create a pruned tree with five terminal nodes._

```{r}
tree1.prune <- prune.misclass(tree1,best = 7)
```

_(j) Compare the training error rates between the pruned and un- pruned trees. Which is higher?_

```{r}
summary(tree1)
summary(tree1.prune)
```

The unpruned tree has slightly lowre error rate

_(k) Compare the test error rates between the pruned and unpruned trees. Which is higher?_

```{r}
prune.predict <- predict(tree1.prune,newdata = oj.test, type="class")
table(prediction=prune.predict,observed=oj.test$Purchase)
tree1.accuracy
(prune.accuracy <- mean(prune.predict==oj.test$Purchase))
```

Test accuracy is the same on either tree
