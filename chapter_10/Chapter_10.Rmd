## Q6

### a.  _explain what is meant by explains 10% of the variation_

The total variance is the sum of the variance present in each tissue sample.  Variance along the first principal component is 1/10 of this sum.

### b. 

The first PC may not perfectly map to the machine type.  For example, if by random chance more T (or C) were run on machine A or B that could be a problem.

Better to me seems to do do a regression that include T vs C and A vs B

### c _simulation_

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
genes <- 1000
samples <- 100
data <- rnorm(genes*samples) %>% matrix(nrow=genes)
```

```{r}
machine <- c(sample(c("A","B"),50,replace = TRUE, prob = c(.8,.2)),
             sample(c("A","B"),50,replace = TRUE, prob = c(.2,.8)))


```
